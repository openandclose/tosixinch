**Unreleased:**
---------------


v0.3.0 (2020-02-24)
-------------------

**Change:**

* **[!]** Cut add_extractors and move man hook to pre_percmd2

  Change you config (If you are using) from:

      add_extractors=   _man

  To:

      pre_percmd2=      _man

**Add:**

v0.2.0 (2019-11-10)
-------------------

**Change:**

* Change one of sample urls. Local templite.py to remote textwrap.py.

* Stop adding suffix to query url.

  Previously url 'bb?cc' was changed to Downloaded_File 'bb?cc/index--tosixinch' or 'bb?cc_index--tosixinch'.
  Now just to 'bb?cc'.

* Stop adding './' prefix unconditionally for relative references.
  Now only when necessary to comply to url spec (colon-in-first-path case).

* **[!]** Change 'userprocess' to just 'process'.
  So Users have to rename this 'userprocess' directory if used.

* **[!]** Change (rather Fix) default encodings, to only utf-8 and cp1252.

* **[!]** Change 'preprocess' option name to 'defaultprocess'.
  Again, users have to rename this option if used.

* pdfname (when the script creates) is made more descriptive.

* Add maximum argument to delete_duplicate_br (process/gen.py)

**Add:**

* Add auto_css feature (see doc: overview.html#dword-auto_css_directory).

* Add trimdirs option.

  Remove flaky automatic path shortening (minsep), add this manual but reliable option.

* Add printout option.

  Print out filenames the scripts' actions would create.

* Add encoding_errors option (for codec Error Handler).

* Add urlreplace feature (see doc: topics.html#urlreplace).

* Add multi commands feature for hookcmds.

* Add add_extractors option (now only for man).

* Add per-cmd hooks (pre_percmds and post_percmds).

* Add --null option to script/open_viewer.py.

**Fix:**

* Fix relative reference when base url is local. (_Component.__init__)

* Fix blank API documents in readthedocs site (The previous fix was wrong).

* Fix ftfy calling procedure (it should be *after* successful decoding).

  (The file url handling has changed: immediately change it to filepath

**Dev:**

* Develop abstract path functions to try to absorb windows path specifics,
  only to revert them back in the end.
  The period is especially unsuitable for forking or otherwise using the code::

v0.1.0 (2019-05-09)
-------------------

**Fix:**

* sample.t.css exclusion in installation

**Dev:**

* Change version scheme.

  I've been using only the third digit for version, since I thought v0.1.0 was too pretentious.

* Accept very long html start tag (now support hatenablog.com).
* Broken '--sample-pdf' and '--appcheck' (no urls case etc.).

**Dev:**

* Continuing the big refactoring (now util.py is gone).

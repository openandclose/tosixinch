=============

process
-------

``process`` package includes ``util``, ``gen`` and ``site`` modules,
and each module mostly consists of top level functions.

They are all simplest functions,
and not particularly easier to use,
so users don't have to use these 'built-ins' preferentially.

The intention is that
by carefully collecting and classifying these functions,
we might be able to survey the problem domain
specific to the script.

.. note::
    This module is copied from Ned Batchelder's
    `Coverage.py <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/coverage/templite.py>`__,
    including docstrings here.

    Small changes are made to work independently.

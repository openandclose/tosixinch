API reference
=============

*some* modules are documented here.


process
-------

.. note::

    ``process`` package includes ``util``, ``gen`` and ``site`` modules,
    and each module mostly consists of top level functions.

    They are all simplest functions,
    and not particularly easier to use,
    so users don't have to use these 'built-ins' preferentially.


process.util
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automodule:: tosixinch.process.util
    :members:


process.gen
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automodule:: tosixinch.process.gen
    :members:


process.site
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automodule:: tosixinch.process.site
    :members:


templite
--------

.. note::

    This module is copied from Ned Batchelder's Coverage.py,
    including docstrings here.
    see `templite.py <topics.html#script-templite.py>`__

    Small changes are made to work independently.


.. automodule:: tosixinch.templite
    :members:
